# Supplemental Materials: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales Surveillance Study (2019-2023)

## Overview

This repository contains supplemental materials for the published manuscript evaluating changes in carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) surveillance across 29 US states from 2019 to 2023. These materials provide additional methodological details, data, and analyses to support the findings presented in the main publication.

**Manuscript DOI:** [doi:10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404](https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404)

## Study Purpose

This study evaluated temporal trends and geographic patterns of carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CP-CRE) across participating US states to assess changes in surveillance capacity and disease burden over a five-year period.

## Study Objective

- **Primary Objective:** Assess changes in CP-CRE detection and reporting across 29 US states from 2019-2023
